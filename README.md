# 📘 First Year DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice repository!  
This repo contains all the code I practiced during my **first year** at IIT Jammu while learning core DSA concepts.  
Although I'm pushing it now—after finishing second year—this code reflects my learning curve from the very beginning. 💻✨

- Arrays & Vectors
- Strings
- Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- HashMaps & HashSets
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)
- Heaps
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)

### ⚙️ Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Sliding Window Technique
- Two Pointers
- Prefix Sum
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (Basics & Medium-level)
